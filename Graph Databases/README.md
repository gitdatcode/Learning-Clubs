## Notes

We will be doing the majority of our work in the terminal/console/command application of your operating system. Luckily for us, Gremlin is built on the Java8 runtime and is portable across Linux, Windows, and MacOS.

Get comfortable with your OS’ terminal application, How to open the terminal in:


- Windows: https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-open-terminal-in-windows
- MacOS: http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line
- Linux: do you need a link?
